## Description

This contains original Julia codes and some modifications in tutorial codes.

## Changes to Julia codes

### bug fixes
- fixed versions are saved as `test/tuto_mdl_obs_modified.ipynb` and its CLI version, `test/tuto_mdl_obs_modified.jl`

### Binary Files (.jls)

Two Julia binary files, `observe_freqs.jls` and `observ_sky.jls` were pre-computed as those require a relatively long computation time. Those binary files can be loaded by above bug fixed Julia code and its Jupyter notebook, instead of direct computations.
